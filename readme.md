> A dark colorscheme for [Gnome Terminal](https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-terminal).

This colorscheme is based on the well-known __Solarized Dark__ colorscheme for the Gnome Terminal, it was created using [Dracula's color palette](https://github.com/zenorocha/dracula-theme#color-palette).

Installation
----------------------

This theme can be installed on Gnome 3 terminal and any other Gnome based terminal program like the Unity terminal bundled with Ubuntu.

You'll need the `dconf` command (if you run a recent Gnome version). In Ubuntu,this can be installed by running:

    $ sudo apt-get install dconf-cli

In other distros you'll need to dig around to find it, search your repositories for __dconf__ related packages.

After installing dconf, you can clone this repository to your machine.

    $ git clone https://github.com/GalaticStryder/gnome-terminal-colors-dracula
    $ cd gnome-terminal-colors-dracula

Then you can run the installation script:

    $ ./install.sh

And just follow the steps.

Addons
----------------------

To complement your user experience I recommend installing [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md). This is going to allow commands to have their own colors and styles.
